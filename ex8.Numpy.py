#What is NumPy?
# NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.
    
#Why Use NumPy?
# In Python we have lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process.
# NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists.
# The array object in NumPy is called ndarray, it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with ndarray very easy.

#Why is NumPy Faster Than Lists?
# NumPy arrays are stored at one continuous place in memory unlike lists, so processes can access and manipulate them very efficiently.
# This behavior is called locality of reference in computer science.
# This is the main reason why NumPy is faster than lists. Also it is optimized to work with latest CPU architectures.
